Shurima was once a glorious empire, its capital a prosperous city basking in radiant light and power. But it fell to ruin when its last emperor was betrayed by his closest friend.
Rumors spread of a golden warrior ascended from the sands, blazing a path through the desert. And upon the path he treads, cities and armies arise.
The inhabitants of Shurima can feel it, the return of their lost emperor. Every last human, animal, and creature of the sand bows in anticipation of the arrival of their ruler. 
The wind carries a message, a message that all must heed. All hail! Azir, your emperor has returned.
In his first life, Azir was the youngest son of his family, never considered fit to become the emperor of shurima. 
Azir met Xerath, a slave boy during his studies. Azir took a liking to Xerath and cared for him like a brother. 
Some believe that Azir was the culprit behind the death of his father and brothers. Or perhaps, it was by some other unseen hand that Azir became emperor.
Shurima is an empire built upon the backs of slavery. But Azir had a secret goal that none knew of. He planned to grant all of the slaves in Shurima the greatest gift of all, freedom. 
Xerath convinced Azir that he needed to become Ascended to bring Shurima to its fullest potential. On the day of the ritual, Azir was betrayed by his closest friend Xerath, and tragedy befell Shurima.
Azir lost his life to the sun disc's fire. Thousands of years passed. But one fateful day, the blood of his descendent fell upon his burial grounds and Azir arose from the sand. His descendant was known as...Sivir.
Aatrox is one of Shurima's Ascended. 
To keep the wise and powerful Nasus and Renekton away from his scheme, Xerath summoned Brand to wreck havoc on the land. 
Ezreal got his gauntlet from a Shuriman tomb.
Kaisa was a normal girl born in the southern regions of Shurima. After being claimed by the void, she became...Kai'Sa.
Malzahar was a Shuriman seer that turned to the dark. He became known as the leader of the "Cult of the Void".
Rhaast is one of Shurima's Ascended.
Varus was one of Shurima's Ascended.
Setaka was the first Ascended being of Shurima. She was known as the Warrior Queen and wielded Chalicar--a blade now held by none other than Sivir. 
Taliyah hails from a tribe of cloth weavers, little did they know that she was to become a weaver of stone.
Yasuo is Taliyah's mentor. They share a quote, "I will follow this path until the end". 
Yasuo calls Taliyah, "Little Sparrow".
Taliyah's favorite ice cream is...rocky road.
Taliyah's favorite animals are goats. Who doesn't like goats?
In game, Azir can dance like Michael Jackson. He even has backup dancers in the form of his soldiers.
During development, Azir was referred to as his codename...Seth.
Azir is just over 3000 years old.
"What is a Baron to an EMPEROR? Shuriman sands flow ever in our favour."
Azir does not particularly like Ezreal-- or any tomb thieves. The one exception is Sivir, for she is family after all.
Nasus and Renekton were Azir's mentors when he was growing up.
Azir is no anti-furry, he is welcoming towards any Yordles who direct their efforts towards the rebuilding of Shurima.
Amumu is at least 6000 years old. He is ANCIENT!
Nasus directly translates to Nose in Latin, references his long snout.
Nasus is roughly 3800 years old, he fought alongside Setaka for centuries.
Nasus is Renekton's elder brother, they became Ascended at the same time.
Renekton is roughly 3800 years old, he fought alongside Setaka for centuries.
After Xerath's betrayal, Renekton battled Xerath into the depths of the Tomb of the Emperors, where Nasus attempted to sealed them for all eternity.
Renekton's sanity was destroyed during his centuries long battle with Xerath, and now he seeks the destruction of his own brother, Nasus.
Rammus: ok.
Rammus is at least 6000 years old.
Some believe that Rammus is an Ascended being, an ancient god amonst men who rolls to Shurima's aid as an armored guardian in its times of need.
A prince to a vast kingdom was once saved by Rammus, this prince was soon inspired to renounced his royalty and he became a goat farmer.
Rammus once stopped a Noxian attack on the Temple of the Ascended by driving by and dropping emormous stone blocks into the Noxian army. Some say he merely did it to protect his favorite cactus flowers.
Skarner is the most powerful of the Brackern. His stone chose him for his strength, persistence, and courage.
The Brackern are all but immortal. The powerful crystals imbued within them grant them life for thousands of years.
Rengar hails from a tribeof Shuriman vastaya known as the Kiilash, those who venerate the glory of the hunt.
Rengar is the son of his tribe's cheiftain, but he was abandoned for his small stature.
Abandoned by his tribe, Rengar became strong in the tough widlerness of Shurima. Eventually, he returned, killed his father, and turned his back on the tribe for good.
Rengar lost one of his eyes in a rash battle with the Void monster, Kha'Zix.
Shuriman priests conducted the Ascension ritual to save an ill struck Nasus, however he was too frail to step into the golden light. His brother, Renekton carried him into the light and both of them emerged Ascended.
